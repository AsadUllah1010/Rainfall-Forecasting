# Rainfall-Forecasting
Rainfall is a critical element of India’s climate system, which impacts agriculture, water resources, and the overall economy.
# Introduction
In this analysis, we aim to uncover long-term trends, seasonal patterns, and anomalies in India’s rainfall data. We will examine historical rainfall trends, detect years with extreme or deficient rainfall, explore relationships between seasonal and annual rainfall, and forecast future rainfall using time series models. For this analysis, we rely on a dataset containing monthly, seasonal, and annual rainfall measurements spanning over a century. I found an ideal dataset for this task, which includes monthly rainfall values, seasonal aggregations (e.g., monsoon rainfall), and annual totals, all of which are essential for understanding variability, detecting anomalies, and predicting future trends. To understand the broader trends, we will plot three plots:
1. We will plot annual rainfall over time and compare it with the overall mean. This helps identify whether there is a noticeable long-term trend, such as an increase or decrease in rainfall over the years.
2. We will calculate the average rainfall for each month across all years. And by plotting a bar chart, we can identify the months with the highest and lowest average rainfall.
3. Next, we will analyze seasonal rainfall by aggregating rainfall data into four seasons: Jan-Feb, Mar-May, Jun-Sep (Monsoon), and Oct-Dec.

# Conclusion
The blue line represents the model’s forecast trend, while the shaded area indicates the confidence interval. The trend reveals a slight decline in annual rainfall over time, with notable year-to-year variability (black dots representing actual data points). The model captures the variability well but highlights that future rainfall may continue to slightly decrease, which emphasizes the need for adaptive strategies to manage potential water resource challenges. The analysis of India’s rainfall trends and patterns from 1901 to 2015 reveals significant variability in annual and seasonal rainfall, with the monsoon season (June-September) being the dominant contributor. Anomalous years of extreme drought and wetness highlight the unpredictability of rainfall, while clustering shows a shift towards more dry years in recent decades. Correlations indicate the limited dependency of non-monsoon seasons on monsoon rainfall. A time-series forecast using Prophet suggests a slight declining trend in annual rainfall, which emphasises the need for long-term water resource planning and adaptation to changing climate patterns.
